# AppSeller

## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

"Manipulate seller registrations in a simple way."

PS: Seller Registration was just the context chosen by me for this project, but all the code inside this application can be reused for any application that has CRUD as a domain, so you can reuse everything here in your next CRUD or anything inside this context!

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio and my assessment on the [BootcamoDevJr](https://bootcampdevjr.com/) course, so I'll be happy if you can give me any feedback on the project, code, structure or that you can report that could make me a better developer!

Also, you can use this Project as you wish, be for study, be for make improvements or earn money with it!

It's free!
